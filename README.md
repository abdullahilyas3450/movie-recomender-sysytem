# movie-recomender-sysytem
build a movie recomender system using techniques like vectorization in building the model
the app.py is with basics functions and calling of the model but the app2.py has optimized code and better ui and also cache so if you recommend for the same movie twice you gwt a faster and quick response also i have used api for fetching the posters of the movies and also a link is added for the trailer of the movie  for UI i have used strem lit as my focus was creating the ml model not the UI you can make the UI more good if ypou want
